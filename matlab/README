This package is a subset of the Yael package. It offers a pre-compiled Matlab 
interface to some of the Yael functions. 

On most architecture, running the default Make command (Make.m) should work 
either from Matlab or from the command line, i.e.:
1) Either launch matlab and launch
> Make
2) Or execute the file Make.m as a bash file:
bash> bash Make.m

In order to adjust the configuration, you can also execute Configure m-file
from Matlab. This will override the Make.m


For the full C and python interfaces, or to get the Mex-files corresponding 
to the pre-compiled files, download the yael_vXXX.tar.gz file instead.
